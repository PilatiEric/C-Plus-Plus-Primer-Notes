1) Functions
2) Gives access to the iostream preprocessor
3) Allows the use of the std library
4) cout << "Hello, World" << endl;
5) int cheeses;
6) cheeses = 32;
7) cin >> cheeses;
8) cout << "We have " << cheeses << " variety of cheese."
9) a) The function takes in a double and returns an int
   b) The function takes in an int and doesn't return anything
   c) The function doesn't take in anything and returns an int
10) The keyword "return" has to be used whenever a function is indicated to return anything but type void
11) It means that access to the namespace std has not been granted
    Ways to solve:
    a) Place "using namespace std;" within the main()
    b) Place "using std::cout" within the main()
    c) Use std::cout
